## Description
This project serves as a revamped version of my [previous portfolio site](https://github.com/richie-duong/Personal-Website). The website contains a list of my qualifications, a demonstration of past & ongoing projects, and my general knowledge in using the React.js library for this web application. Additionally, this project demonstrates a fully functioning contact form using the [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) library that was imported and integrated within the project. Unlike previous projects, this project is completely frontend (since it was deployed on GitHub Pages). A large portion of my time on this project was spent on making this website as responsive as possible, a feature that was lacking in my previous portfolio site.

## Frameworks / Libraries Used
Below is a complete list of libraries used within this project:
* [React-Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll) - React component that allows for vertical scrolling animation upon clicking on navigation bar elements.
* [React-Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - Library that allows for inclusion of popular icons utilizing ES6 imports to be used within React.js project. This was used heavily in the 'Skills' section of this project.
* [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction) - Used for styling buttons.
* [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/examples/reactjs/) - Library for popular frameworks such as React.js, responsible for sending emails using client-side technology, no servers being required. This was used in the 'Contact Me' form and is fully functioning.
