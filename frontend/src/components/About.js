                <img id='headshot' src="richard.png" alt='Richard Headshot' />
                <p>My name is Richard Duong, and I recently graduated with honours from Algonquin College's <strong>Computer Programming Diploma</strong> program.
                    There, I studied programming fundamentals including advanced object-oriented concepts, database design, database
                    administration and eventually found a passion in web and software development. These days, I am spending a lot of my time honing my skills in full-stack development, and looking for
                    opportunities that would allow me to continue growing as a <strong>full-stack developer</strong>.</p>
